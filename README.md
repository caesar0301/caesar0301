## 👋 Hi, I'm Xiaming Chen

An independent researcher focusing on **cognitive computation**, **reasoning systems**, and **multi-agent systems**. I enjoy bridging neural and symbolic AI, and researching on the fundamental mechanisms of intelligence such as memorization, reasoning, continual learning etc. 📚 Also writer of [blogs](https://www.xiaming.site), [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9GzdwPEAAAAJ), and a [Ph.D. dissertation](https://github.com/caesar0301/phd-dissertation).

## 🛠️ Featured Projects & Contributions

- 🧠 [**cogents**](https://www.xiaming.site/2025/08/30/project-cogents/): Towards a cognitive agentic AI system with modular design.

- 🧱 [**treelib**](https://github.com/caesar0301/treelib): Efficient, pure Python implementation of tree data structures—widely used for hierarchical modeling and algorithmic workflows.

- 🔗 [**graphsim**](https://github.com/caesar0301/graphsim): A collection of graph similarity algorithms built on NetworkX for graph mining and structural comparisons.
