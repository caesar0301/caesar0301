## 👋 Hi, I'm Xiaming Chen

A researcher and engineer focused on **cognitive computation**, **reasoning systems**, and **multi-agent architectures**. I enjoy bridging neural and symbolic AI, and designing composable, interpretable agents. 📚 Writer of [blogs](https://www.xiaming.site), [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9GzdwPEAAAAJ), and a [Ph.D. dissertation](https://github.com/caesar0301/phd-dissertation).

## 🛠️ Featured Projects & Contributions

- 🧠 [**COGENTS**](https://github.com/caesar0301/COGENTS): Towards a cognitive agentic AI system with modular design.

- 🧱 [**treelib**](https://github.com/caesar0301/treelib): Efficient, pure Python implementation of tree data structures—widely used for hierarchical modeling and algorithmic workflows.

- 🔗 [**graphsim**](https://github.com/caesar0301/graphsim): A collection of graph similarity algorithms built on NetworkX for graph mining and structural comparisons.

- 🧵 [**http-sniffer**](https://github.com/caesar0301/http-sniffer): Multi-threaded PCAP analyzer that extracts HTTP headers and TCP flow metadata into JSON—ideal for offline traffic inspection.

- 📦 [**pkt2flow**](https://github.com/caesar0301/pkt2flow): Lightweight tool to split packet captures into 4-tuple flow-level files—cross-platform, minimalistic, and reassembly-free.
